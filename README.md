# Professional_Portfolio

## Description
This project aims to create a professional portfolio that displays applications that I created. At this point in time, I do not have any applications created, so I linked the projects to my github account. As I develop applications during my projects, I will replace the linked images with my developed applications. Another goal within this project was to create a navigation bar which, when clicked, will navigate you to the corresponding area on the page. Within the footer, I also included some personal contact information that way a potential employer has all necessary info in order to contact me.

Below is a snapshot of my completed professional portfolio.
