            </div>
    
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>I am currently an aspiring web developer whom is enrolled in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp program. In 2013 I attended St. John's University before transferring to Fairleigh Dickinson University in 2014 where I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Sports Administration. Upon graduation, I worked as the Assistant Groundskeeper for the Somerset Patriots during the 2019 season. After the season I decided to take a different route and became a Service Advisor for a Toyota dealership, which I worked at for a little more than 3 years. After getting married in December of 2022, I decided I wanted to find a career that I can settle into for my future and that is how I became interested in learning code.</p>

                <p>I would love to use my bootcamp certification as a way to integrate my interest in sports into web and application development. I believe my diversified job background is an important factor in understanding who I am; I do not back down from a challange, I am an extremely hard worker and I take pride in perfecting my work. My past jobs have brought about the opportunity to lead teams in completing daily operations and I feel I would be a strong candidate to help grow any company, organization or team that I become a part of. </p>
